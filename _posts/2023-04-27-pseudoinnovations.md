It's both amusing and ironic to see how innovations in automated fare collection (AFC) for public transit are predominantly focused on various methods of payment: QR codes, biometrics, bank cards, and the countless "* Pays" options.

This fixation on payment methods is a perfect example of how we often try to solve non-existent problems, while overlooking the actual concerns that matter to transit operators.

ðŸ“ˆ The core objectives of AFC systems should be to ensure full fare collection at minimum costs and to boost revenue for transport operators. These are the areas that need our attention and innovation, rather than continually exploring new ways to pay.

It's better to shift the focus to what truly matters and make public transportation more efficient and profitable for everyone involved.
