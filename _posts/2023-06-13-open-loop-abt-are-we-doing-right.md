The Clock is Ticking: Open-Loop Payments & Account-Based Ticketing, Are We Doing It Right?

I strongly believe that it's only a matter of time before banks and public transit agencies realize that the current implementation of "open loop payments" and "account-based ticketing" in public transit is not beneficial.

This approach falls short not just for public transit and passengers, but even for the banks themselves.

However, the longer this realization is delayed, the more damage they will inflict on public transport, and consequently, our pockets.
